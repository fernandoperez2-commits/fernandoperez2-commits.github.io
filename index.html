<h1> Welcome </h1>

<p> This where <strong> our journey begins!</strong>! </p>
  <p>Take some time to think of what you would like to build here, and how you want to build it.</p>
  <p> Now that you have done that, I want to say thank you for taking your time to learn with me, and hopefully strive with me</p>
<p> Shall We get to cooking?!</p>
